## About

The customisation of authentication responses in Laravel provides a lot of flexibility for us to shape the way authentication is done within their applications. By leveraging the power of Laravel Fortify and its Service Providers, we can easily implement custom responses for registration and login endpoints, email verification, and even handle the creation of tokens for authenticated users. The Project demonstrates how to carry out these customizations and also provide steps to test if the custom responses have been properly implemented. By following these steps, we can create a more robust and secure authentication system for our applications.
