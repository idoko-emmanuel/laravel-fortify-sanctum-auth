## About

The customization of authentication responses in Laravel provides a lot of flexibility for us to shape the way authentication is done within our applications. By leveraging the power of Laravel Fortify and its Service Providers, we can easily implement custom responses for registration and login endpoints, email verification, and even handle the creation of tokens for authenticated users. The Project demonstrates how to carry out these customizations and also provides steps to test if the custom responses have been properly implemented. By following these steps, we can create a more robust and secure authentication system for our applications.

## Testing API with Postman

To ensure the proper implementation of custom responses, we have provided a Postman collection for testing the API endpoints. The collection includes pre-configured requests to test registration, login, email verification, and other authentication-related functionalities. Follow the steps outlined in our testing guide to validate the behavior of your authentication system.
